Welcome to the Fullstack E-Commerce Shopping Project repository! This project is a work in progress and aims to build a comprehensive e-commerce application using React.js for the front-end and Spring Boot for the backend. Once completed, it will offer a complete online shopping experience with features like product browsing, cart management, and order processing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Being Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Payment Gateway**: (Optional integration with Stripe/PayPal)
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Webpack

## 🧪 Mutation Testing Analysis

We utilize **PIT (Pitest)** for mutation testing to ensure the robustness of our test suite. Mutation testing goes beyond code coverage by introducing small changes ("mutants") to the code and verifying if the tests fail (killing the mutant).

### Analysis Process
1.  **Reviewing the Report:** We analyze the `index.html` generated by PIT to identify surviving mutants.
2.  **Identifying Weaknesses:**
    *   **Void Method Calls:** If a method call (like `repository.save()`) is removed and tests pass, it means we aren't verifying side effects.
    *   **Return Values:** If a return value is changed to `null` and tests pass, it means our assertions are too loose (e.g., checking `assertNotNull` instead of specific fields).
3.  **Improving Tests:**
    *   **Verification:** We added `Mockito.verify()` calls to ensure all repository and service interactions occur as expected.
    *   **Strict Assertions:** We replaced generic assertions with specific value checks (e.g., `assertEquals("expected", actual.getField())`).

### Improvements Made
Based on the analysis, we significantly improved the test strength of `CategoryServiceTest` and others by:
*   Verifying that `categoryRepository.findById()` and `save()` are called with correct arguments.
*   Asserting all fields of returned objects (Name, Code, Description) to prevent null-return mutants from surviving.
*   Ensuring that complex logic, such as updating nested `CategoryType` lists, is fully exercised and verified.
